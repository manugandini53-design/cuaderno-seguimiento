# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

"Cuaderno de seguimiento" — a single-page PWA (in Spanish) for a math tutor to track students: exam dates, topic progress, class logs, and mock-exam ("simulacro") results. No backend server of its own; optional cross-device sync goes directly to a user-configured Supabase project. It also ships as a desktop app via Tauri (see "Desktop packaging (Tauri)" below) and, in progress, as an Android app via Capacitor (see "Android packaging (Capacitor)" below).

There is no build system, no package manager, and no dependencies for the web app itself. The entire app is `web/index.html` (HTML + CSS + vanilla JS in inline `<style>`/`<script>` tags). `web/sw.js` is the service worker, `web/manifest.webmanifest` is the PWA manifest, `web/icon-*.png` are app icons. These files live in `web/` (rather than the repo root) so that `src-tauri/`'s `frontendDist` can point at a directory containing only the deployable web assets, without sweeping in `node_modules/`, `.git/`, or `src-tauri/target/`.

## Running / testing

There is no build, lint, or test tooling for the web app.

- Open `web/index.html` directly in a browser to run the app. `localStorage` and rendering work over `file://`.
- The service worker only registers over `http(s)://` and never inside Tauri/Capacitor (see `IS_NATIVE` and the guard at the bottom of `web/index.html`), so to exercise offline/PWA/caching behavior, serve the `web/` directory with any static file server (e.g. `python -m http.server`) rather than opening the file directly.
- After editing `web/sw.js`, bump `CACHE` (currently `"cuaderno-v3"`) — the service worker only picks up new/changed files on install, and stale caches are only evicted for keys that don't match `CACHE`.
- Manual testing only: exercise flows in the browser (create/edit/delete a student, cycle topic/semaforo state, log a class/simulacro, export/import JSON, and — if testing sync — the Supabase config/login flow).

## PWA deployment (GitHub Pages)

`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` publishes `web/` to GitHub Pages automatically on every push to `main` that touches `web/**` (via `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages`). The repo's Settings → Pages → Source must be set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch") for this to take effect — see `INSTRUCCIONES.md` for the end-user-facing walkthrough.

## Desktop packaging (Tauri)

`src-tauri/` wraps `web/` as a native Windows/macOS/Linux app — no bundler, no build step for the web files, which remain the single source of truth. `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` sets `build.frontendDist` to `../web` directly (no `devUrl`, no `beforeDevCommand`/`beforeBuildCommand`).

- `npm install` once to fetch `@tauri-apps/cli` locally (dev dependency only, no bundler for the app code).
- `npm run tauri dev` to run the desktop app against the live files in `web/`.
- `npm run tauri build` to produce an installable bundle.
- `window.__TAURI__` (injected by Tauri) and `window.Capacitor` (injected by Capacitor, if ever added) are detected via `IS_NATIVE` near the top of `web/index.html`'s script — used to skip service worker registration, since a native shell resolves local files itself and doesn't need it.
- If you regenerate icons from `web/icon-512.png`, run `npx tauri icon web/icon-512.png` from the repo root; it writes into `src-tauri/icons/`.

## Android packaging (Capacitor)

`android/` wraps `web/` as a native Android app via Capacitor. `capacitor.config.json` at the repo root sets `webDir: "web"` — same source files as the PWA and the Tauri build, no separate copy to maintain by hand.

- Capacitor does not serve `web/` live like Tauri does — it **copies** it into `android/app/src/main/assets/public` (gitignored, regenerated) whenever you run `npx cap sync` or `npx cap copy android`. Run that after editing anything in `web/` and before rebuilding the Android app; otherwise the APK ships stale assets.
- `window.Capacitor` (checked by `IS_NATIVE` in `web/index.html`, alongside `window.__TAURI__`) makes the service worker registration skip itself inside the Android app too.
- Building an APK requires Android Studio (JDK + Android SDK); open the project with `npx cap open android` or directly at `android/`. Verified working: builds and installs on a physical device. Gradle/AGP versions in `android/build.gradle` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` are pinned to whatever Android Studio's Upgrade Assistant last set them to — don't hand-edit those versions down, Android Studio will just re-upgrade them on next open.
- `android/.idea/` is gitignored (IDE/machine-local state — deployment target, run configs, etc.); each contributor's Android Studio regenerates it on first open.

## Architecture

Everything lives in `index.html`'s `<script>` block as one flat, dependency-free program. There is no module system, framework, or router.

- **State**: a single mutable `state` object (students, catalog, current view/tab/filters, sync status). `state.students` is the source of truth for all tutoring data; `state.catalog` holds configurable careers/subjects/units.
- **Render loop**: `render()` rebuilds the *entire* `#app` innerHTML from `state` on every change (`vTablero`, `vLista`, `vDetalle`, `vSync`, `vCatalog`, `vModal` each return an HTML string for one view/section). There's no diffing — this is a from-scratch string-template re-render, not a vdom.
- **Events**: one delegated `click` listener and one delegated `change` listener on `document`, dispatching on `data-a` (action) and `data-f`/`data-cf` (field) attributes read off `e.target.closest(...)`. To add a new interactive action: give the element `data-a="my-action"`, handle it in the big `if/else if` chain in the click listener, then call `render()` (falling through to the bottom) or `return` early if you already re-rendered via `update()`/`touchCatalog()`.
- **Persistence**: `save()` writes `{students, catalog}` to `localStorage` under `KEY` on every mutation, then debounces a sync via `scheduleSync()`. `update(id, patch)` and `touchCatalog()` are the two mutation helpers — both stamp `updatedAt: Date.now()`, which is also the conflict-resolution field for sync.
- **Sync (optional, per-device opt-in)**: hand-rolled Supabase client using raw `fetch` against the Auth (`/auth/v1/...`) and PostgREST (`/rest/v1/cuaderno`) endpoints — no `supabase-js` SDK. Config (`CFG_KEY`, project URL + anon key) and session tokens (`SES_KEY`) live in `localStorage`, separate from the app data key so they don't round-trip through export/import or get wiped by a data restore. `syncNow()` fetches the remote row, merges students by `mergeStudents()` (last-write-wins per student via `updatedAt`), and upserts. It's called on load, on `online` events, on a 5-minute interval, and 1.5s after any local save (debounced via `scheduleSync()`). The app is fully usable offline; sync is best-effort and silently degrades to `offline`/`error` status shown in the header.
- **Catalog vs. per-student data**: `state.catalog.subjects[].units` defines the topic list for a subject; each student's `topics` map (topic name → status in `TOPIC_CYCLE`) is independent per-student data seeded from the catalog at creation time, so editing a subject's units later doesn't retroactively touch existing students' progress (see the hint text in `vCatalog`).
- **Soft delete**: students are never hard-deleted locally except by the 90-day sweep in `load()` (`s.deleted && updatedAt older than 90 days`); `confirm-del` just sets `deleted: true` so the deletion can propagate through sync before being purged.
- **PWA/offline**: `sw.js` cache-first serves same-origin GET requests (falling back to network, then to `./index.html` if both fail) and explicitly bypasses cross-origin requests so Supabase calls always hit the network.

## Conventions in this codebase

- Vanilla JS, no semicolons-optional style — existing code uses semicolons consistently; match it.
- All user-facing strings are in Spanish (Argentina locale, e.g. `toLocaleDateString("es-AR", ...)`); keep new UI text consistent with that.
- HTML is built via template strings; always run user-supplied text through `esc()` before interpolating into HTML to avoid XSS.
- Dates are stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings and compared/parsed via `daysTo()`/`fmtDate()`, which pin to noon local time to avoid timezone-boundary bugs — reuse these helpers rather than calling `new Date()` directly on stored date strings.
