# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

"Cuaderno de seguimiento" — a product (in Spanish) for a math tutor to track students: exam dates, topic progress, class logs, and mock-exam ("simulacro") results, with accounts and cross-device sync backed by a single shared Supabase project (multi-tenant via RLS — see `web/app/index.html`'s `SUPA_URL`/`SUPA_ANON_KEY`). It ships as a PWA, a desktop app via Tauri, and (in progress) an Android app via Capacitor.

`web/` is the site published to GitHub Pages, and has two independent, self-contained parts:
- `web/index.html` — the marketing/landing page (product site root). Static HTML/CSS/JS, no shared state with the app, links to `./app/` and to GitHub Releases for downloads.
- `web/app/` — the actual application: `index.html` (HTML + CSS + vanilla JS in inline `<style>`/`<script>` tags), `sw.js` (service worker), `manifest.webmanifest` (PWA manifest), `icon-*.png`. This is what the Tauri and Capacitor builds wrap.

There is no build system, no package manager, and no dependencies for either the landing page or the app — both are hand-authored, self-contained files. `web/` lives outside the repo root (rather than files sitting at the repo root) so that `src-tauri/`'s `frontendDist` can point at a directory containing only deployable web assets, without sweeping in `node_modules/`, `.git/`, or `src-tauri/target/`.

## Running / testing

There is no build, lint, or test tooling.

- Open `web/index.html` (landing) or `web/app/index.html` (app) directly in a browser. `localStorage` and rendering work over `file://`.
- The app's service worker only registers over `http(s)://` and never inside Tauri/Capacitor (see `IS_NATIVE` and the guard at the bottom of `web/app/index.html`), so to exercise offline/PWA/caching behavior, serve the `web/` directory with any static file server (e.g. `python -m http.server` from `web/`) rather than opening the file directly. The service worker's default scope is `/app/` (it's registered via a bare relative `"sw.js"` from a script that lives in `app/`), so it never intercepts requests for the landing page.
- After editing `web/app/sw.js`, bump `CACHE` (currently `"cuaderno-v4"`) — the service worker only picks up new/changed files on install, and stale caches are only evicted for keys that don't match `CACHE`.
- Manual testing only: exercise flows in the browser (login/signup, create/edit/delete a student, cycle topic/semaforo state, log a class/simulacro, export/import JSON, offline behavior, logout).

## PWA deployment (GitHub Pages)

`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` publishes the whole `web/` directory (landing at the site root, app at `/app/`) to GitHub Pages automatically on every push to `main` that touches `web/**` (via `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages`). The repo's Settings → Pages → Source must be set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch") for this to take effect.

Note: any PWA installed from the site root *before* the landing page existed will keep opening to the landing page under its old install, since its service worker scope was `/`. Users need to uninstall that and reinstall from `/app/` instead — the current app can only be installed from within `/app/`.

## Desktop packaging (Tauri)

`src-tauri/` wraps `web/app/` (not the landing page) as a native Windows/macOS/Linux app — no bundler, no build step for the web files, which remain the single source of truth. `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` sets `build.frontendDist` to `../web/app` directly (no `devUrl`, no `beforeDevCommand`/`beforeBuildCommand`).

- `npm install` once to fetch `@tauri-apps/cli` locally (dev dependency only, no bundler for the app code).
- `npm run tauri dev` to run the desktop app against the live files in `web/app/`.
- `npm run tauri build` to produce an installable bundle (in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`).
- `window.__TAURI__` (injected by Tauri) and `window.Capacitor` (injected by Capacitor) are detected via `IS_NATIVE` near the top of `web/app/index.html`'s script — used to skip service worker registration, since a native shell resolves local files itself and doesn't need it.
- If you regenerate icons from `web/app/icon-512.png`, run `npx tauri icon web/app/icon-512.png` from the repo root; it writes into `src-tauri/icons/`.
- Verified working: builds, installs, and runs on a real Windows device (`.msi` and NSIS `setup.exe`). Bump the version in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` together before a release build.

## Android packaging (Capacitor)

`android/` wraps `web/app/` as a native Android app via Capacitor. `capacitor.config.json` at the repo root sets `webDir: "web/app"` — same source files as the PWA and the Tauri build, no separate copy to maintain by hand.

- Capacitor does not serve `web/app/` live like Tauri does — it **copies** it into `android/app/src/main/assets/public` (gitignored, regenerated) whenever you run `npx cap sync` or `npx cap copy android`. Run that after editing anything in `web/app/` and before rebuilding the Android app; otherwise the APK ships stale assets.
- `window.Capacitor` (checked by `IS_NATIVE` in `web/app/index.html`, alongside `window.__TAURI__`) makes the service worker registration skip itself inside the Android app too.
- Building an APK requires Android Studio (JDK + Android SDK); open the project with `npx cap open android` or directly at `android/`. Verified working: builds and installs on a physical device. Gradle/AGP versions in `android/build.gradle` and `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` are pinned to whatever Android Studio's Upgrade Assistant last set them to — don't hand-edit those versions down, Android Studio will just re-upgrade them on next open.
- `android/.idea/` is gitignored (IDE/machine-local state — deployment target, run configs, etc.); each contributor's Android Studio regenerates it on first open.

## Landing page (`web/index.html`)

Pure static marketing page, entirely separate from the app's code/state — no shared JS, no localStorage use. Links to `./app/` for the web app and to GitHub Releases for native downloads. Its only dynamic behavior: a small inline script calls the public GitHub API (`GET /repos/manugandini53-design/manugandini53-design.github.io/releases/latest`) to populate the Windows download button with the actual latest `.exe` asset URL, version tag, and size, falling back to a link to the releases page if that call fails (offline, rate-limited, no release yet, etc.). Reuses the app's CSS custom properties (colors, font stack) for visual consistency but duplicates them locally, same as every other file in this repo — there's no shared stylesheet.

## Architecture (`web/app/index.html`)

Everything lives in `web/app/index.html`'s `<script>` block as one flat, dependency-free program. There is no module system, framework, or router.

- **State**: a single mutable `state` object (students, catalog, current view/tab/filters, sync/auth status). `state.students` is the source of truth for all tutoring data; `state.catalog` holds configurable careers/subjects/units.
- **Render loop**: `render()` rebuilds the *entire* `#app` innerHTML from `state` on every change. It gates on auth first: if `state.recovery` is set it shows only `vSetPassword()`; else if there's no saved session (`!getSes()`) it shows only `vAuth()` (login/signup) — no other view is reachable without a session. Once authenticated, it renders the normal app shell (`vTablero`, `vLista`, `vDetalle`, `vCuenta`, `vCatalog`, `vModal`). There's no diffing — this is a from-scratch string-template re-render, not a vdom.
- **Events**: one delegated `click` listener and one delegated `change` listener on `document`, dispatching on `data-a` (action) and `data-f`/`data-cf` (field) attributes read off `e.target.closest(...)`. To add a new interactive action: give the element `data-a="my-action"`, handle it in the big `if/else if` chain in the click listener, then call `render()` (falling through to the bottom) or `return` early if you already re-rendered via `update()`/`touchCatalog()`.
- **Persistence**: `save()` writes `{students, catalog}` to `localStorage` under `KEY` on every mutation, then debounces a sync via `scheduleSync()`. `update(id, patch)` and `touchCatalog()` are the two mutation helpers — both stamp `updatedAt: Date.now()`, which is also the conflict-resolution field for sync.
- **Backend / auth (single shared Supabase project, multi-tenant)**: `SUPA_URL`/`SUPA_ANON_KEY` are embedded constants — every install of the app talks to the same Supabase project; per-user data isolation comes entirely from Supabase Auth + RLS on the `cuaderno` table (see `supabase-setup.sql`), not from per-device config. There is no `supabase-js` SDK — it's a hand-rolled client using raw `fetch` against the Auth (`/auth/v1/...`) and PostgREST (`/rest/v1/cuaderno`) endpoints. Session tokens live in `localStorage` under `SES_KEY`, separate from the app data key (`KEY`) so they don't round-trip through export/import or get wiped by a data restore.
- **Offline-first after login**: the auth gate in `render()` only checks whether a session is *saved* (`getSes()`), never whether its token is currently valid — so a device with no internet still opens straight to the app if it was logged in before. `syncNow()` checks `!navigator.onLine` **before** interpreting any fetch error, so a failed token refresh while offline degrades to an `"offline"` status instead of clearing the session; the session is only cleared (forcing re-login) when a refresh genuinely fails *while online* (revoked/invalid refresh token).
- **Password recovery**: `auth-forgot` POSTs to `/auth/v1/recover` with a `redirect_to` pointing back at the app's own URL. On load, `parseRecoveryHash()` looks for `#access_token=...&type=recovery` in the URL (set by Supabase's email link), stashes it in `state.recovery`, and strips the hash. While `state.recovery` is set, `render()` shows only `vSetPassword()`, which calls `setNewPassword()` (`PUT /auth/v1/user`) and then logs the user in with those tokens.
- **Error messages**: `friendlyAuthError(err)` maps known Supabase Auth error strings (bad credentials, already-registered email, unconfirmed email, offline, rate limits, etc.) to short Spanish messages; used everywhere an auth/sync `fetch` can fail. Prefer extending this over surfacing raw error text.
- **Catalog vs. per-student data**: `state.catalog.subjects[].units` defines the topic list for a subject; each student's `topics` map (topic name → status in `TOPIC_CYCLE`) is independent per-student data seeded from the catalog at creation time, so editing a subject's units later doesn't retroactively touch existing students' progress (see the hint text in `vCatalog`).
- **Soft delete**: students are never hard-deleted locally except by the 90-day sweep in `load()` (`s.deleted && updatedAt older than 90 days`); `confirm-del` just sets `deleted: true` so the deletion can propagate through sync before being purged.
- **PWA/offline**: `sw.js` cache-first serves same-origin GET requests (falling back to network, then to `./index.html` if both fail) and explicitly bypasses cross-origin requests so Supabase calls always hit the network.

## Conventions in this codebase

- Vanilla JS, no semicolons-optional style — existing code uses semicolons consistently; match it.
- All user-facing strings are in Spanish (Argentina locale, e.g. `toLocaleDateString("es-AR", ...)`); keep new UI text consistent with that.
- HTML is built via template strings; always run user-supplied text through `esc()` before interpolating into HTML to avoid XSS.
- Dates are stored as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings and compared/parsed via `daysTo()`/`fmtDate()`, which pin to noon local time to avoid timezone-boundary bugs — reuse these helpers rather than calling `new Date()` directly on stored date strings.
